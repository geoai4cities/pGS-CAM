Train the model for certain epochs. Checkpoints will be stored in results directory.\
Evaluation script will generate pGS-CAM heatmaps.

Example case:-\
To train NPM3D:-\ 
train_NPM3D.py

To obtain pGS-CAM for NPM3D:-\
evaluate_NPM3D.py

Generated heatmaps will be stored in pGSCAM_results directory.
